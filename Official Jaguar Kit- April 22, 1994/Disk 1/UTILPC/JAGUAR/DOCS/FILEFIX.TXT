FILEFIX v6.0 - May 3, 1994
--------------------------

FILEFIX is a utility that converts an ABS executable file output by the ALN
linker into separate files containing the raw data for the TEXT and DATA
sections of the program, and a symbol table containing the symbol information
for the program, and an RDBJAG script file for loading it all into the
ALPINE board of a Jaguar Development System.

Some developers have wondered why FILEFIX is needed, since RDBJAG can read
ABS files directly.  Perhaps the most important reason is that when you want
to build a Jaguar ROM or EPROM cartridge from your program, you need access
to the raw data that cooresponds to what will become the ROM image of the
cartridge.  FILEFIX makes this very easy and convenient.

When you send a program to Atari that may end up becoming a cartridge (like
an early version of a game), please use FILEFIX and send the resulting files
rather than sending an ABS file (or in addition to sending an ABS file).


Changes in this version:
------------------------
Earlier versions of FILEFIX could only deal with DRI-format ABS files.  This
new version of FILEFIX now has the capability to read BSD/COFF format ABS
files in addition to DRI format files.
