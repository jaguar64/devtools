MIDI Parser Tool for ATARI Jaguar
=================================

FILES
	parse.exe (for PC/MSDOS)
	parse.ttp (for ATARI/TOS)
	parse.cnf
	notes.cnf


OVERVIEW

The MIDI parser is a command line program which translates a MIDI file into
commands recognized by the Jaguar syntheziser. The output of the parser is
an ASCII file containing the sound data for the synthesizer in assembly
language format. This file has to be assembled and linked in with your
program, playing the music.


DESCRIPTION

To parse a MIDI file, execute the program (PARSE.EXE or PARSE.TTP) from your
command line (e.g. the MSDOS command prompt or the `Gulam' on the Atari):

		parse [-q] [-o outputname] [inputname]

The input file name is the file name of the MIDI file. If no file name is
provided, parse looks for a file called `test.mid'. If not specified using
the `-o' option, the file name of the output will be `test.out'. The `-q'
option invokes the quite mode, suppressing messages about MIDI notes on/off.

The created output file will have a list of assembly `dc.l' statements
containg the music data for the synthesizer. The global pointer `scoretab'
points to the beginning of the music data.


The files `parse.cnf' and `notes.cnf' allow you to configure the parser.
The `parse.cnf' file gives you the ability to have a certain pitch range
change to a specific patch. Each line in `parse.cnf' contains one pitch
range. The format of the line is:

	channel:   pitch_range_start -  pitch_range_end   patch   pitch_offset

Example:
	0:	2 - 2	24	 64

The `pitch_offset' parameter is an offset which will be added to pitch.
Negative offset are possible, too. If you don't want an offset added,
enter `0' into that field.

Also, `parse.cnf' lets you set the maximum number of channels to be
used. To do so, just enter the line

	n = x

(where x is the number of channels) into `parse.cnf'. Example:

	n = 5

The `Notes.cnf' contains the frequencies cooresponding to each note. Just
change the file with a text editor if you need to do so.
