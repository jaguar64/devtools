This is the third release of the music tools.

The changes from release one include:
	The compressed sample module now works (sorry 'bout that)
	The number of voices used by the music driver can be changed (see parse.cnf)
	Samples can be fine tuned, put the pitch adjustment in the pitch field $1000=>No change
	Parse takes a -q option to prevent the note by note output
	The Sound Tool SNDTOOL now allows easy creation of complex user waveforms
	A Volume parameter has been added for the Music interpreter
	The Sample rate can be changed

The changes from release two include:
	There is sample code showing how to add other voice types or effects. The sample is an echo.
	There is a new parameter, PATCHLOC. This allows patches to be placed anywhere.
	The doc MUSICDRV.RTF has been expanded
