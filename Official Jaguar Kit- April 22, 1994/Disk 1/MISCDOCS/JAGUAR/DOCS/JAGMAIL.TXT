It must be Christmas :-) We've just taken deliver of a Jaguar development
system.

A couple of questions about the Jaguar:
 
1.   We  seem to have some kind of  monitor  conflict  with  Jeff
     Minter's demos. There is something there but the sync is all
     screwed up. Any ideas?
 
2.   If we install the  latest  ROMs (which I guess are needed to
     use the TT development system), then will we  still  be able
     to use the PC tools?
 
3.   How much RAM is fitted to Felix?
 
4.   Are any tools available for  converting  from  other picture
     formats (e.g. DPaint 256 colour) to CRY format?
 
That's all for now.
 
Regards, Rob.

jeff's stuff was ntsc.  Perhaps that is the problem.
felix has 1mb of ram.  That is the same as production machines.
the TT roms work only for the TT.  The TT tools are more complete.
the TT tools include graphics file converters like TIF to CRY.

The simplest fix is to adjust the verticle hold on your monitor.
Did the other programs in the example folder work ok?
If the monitor adjust did not help then do the following:
In VIDINIT:
N_VP EQU 523       ADD 100
N_VDB EQU N_VBE+26    ADJUST THE 26 TO TASTE
N_VBB EQU             MAKE BIGGER

Thanks John, I'll download the utilities. I managed to get most of
the demos working by reassembling with a different value in the
video clock. Having it appeared to work. We're going to need some more
information on this if we start a real project. Regards, Rob.

We got them all working by changing the video clock to half it's value
as supplied in the source. They all worked but the picture only occupied
half the screen across.

In the meantime, us the # key to get a \ and use your

Sig(s)  : 11

  Recently I've been running the demos to get a clue about the system
myself, and during the process, my display appears to be broken into 4
quadrants, where each quadrant has the appearance of a full screen from
what I remember of the November conference demonstrations.  Anyway, the
system is still usable during this part of the learning curve, but if
someone has an idea about how to get rid of this undocumented non-feature
it would be appreciated.  I noticed that someone else mentioned monitor
problems and haven't yet tried that, but they may be different problems.

That explains much... 
LEDS
D1..D3 are always on
D4 is always off
The LED pack does not appear to have any consistant output.
Current Jumper settings on the mother board:
JP5   1
JP2   1
JP3   0
JP4   0
JP9   0
JP6   0
JP7   1
JP8   1

Communications card:
JP1 the right most pins are jumpered.
;
Joystick Interface Jumpered pins:
;
JP2-3
JP1-4

XX. (Bank 0)
Jaguar Rom Card.
Rom and 32bit are jumpered, JP1 is open
;
Symptoms:
(Without the Jaguar Rom card installed)
The bottom 2 leds on the led pack are on, but the other leds are not
consistant. Bringing up the debugger RDBJAG requires usage of a wand,
walking around the machine 3 times, and something else...
;
(With the Jaguar Rom card installed)
All LED's on the LED pack are on, and no response from Felix.

Are there any plans to make MadMac case insensitive?  It's not a real big

Sig(s)  : 11

The huffman compression engine is now ported over to the Atari ST/TT, and
RSN there will be an object file to allow this compression to be used on
both the Jaguar and in other software developer's utilities.  If anyone
would like to kill some time, testing the compression utility and trying
to break it would be appreciated.  When complete it will be a Free
utility for Atari developers.

Subject : .Quad alignment
Sig(s)  : 11

    I noticed something that probably should make sense anyways, but
thought I'd spout it out... During the developement of the compression
engine, I noticed that the timings were unstable, even with '.even'
alignment.  As an experiment, I made sure that all important loops were
padded as necessary with NOP, and got a more consistant timing of the
process.  If there is going to be any further developement on MADMAC, I'd
like two features added, under the following guidelines:
'.quad' or '.align #'
if '.quad' and in the .text segment take one of 2 actions.
If not already even aligned, error out with 'uneven memory, place ".even"
at an appropriate place.  If the memory is not Quad aligned, then place
the following line in its place
dc.l    $4e71       ; nop for align 4
If '.quad' is encountered in the .data segment, add
dc.b    0, and dc.w 0 as needed to provide this alignment factor, and
lastly, if in .bss, ds.b # where # is the number of bytes needed to force
quad alignment.  Doing this by hand was a royal pain, and I see a 5%+
improvement in speed by adding this feature to MADMac.
 
The second suggestion has to do with Jaguar compatibility.  I don't see
any option to provide 'phrase' alignment, and this too might help.  Maybe
2 birds could be killed with one stone, where a 
Macro QUAD
        Align   4
        endm
could fill in the quad gap.  The most important detail to this alignment
is that in .text that nop is placed where needed.
