This code needs an Alpine Development Board and Jaguar Console to 
run correctly.  Until you receive them, do a conditional assembly 
of your games without the code for your use and an assembly with 
the code for us to test and confirm.   Running the code on a 
system without the EEPROM will cause the game to hang, as it will 
wait for a confirmation on write.  Thanks - John Skruch
