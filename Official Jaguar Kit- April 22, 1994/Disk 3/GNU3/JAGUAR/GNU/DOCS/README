Overview:

This package contains a 32-bit 80386 DOS extender with symbolic
debugger, a C/C++ compiler with utilities, development libraries, and
source code.  It generates full 32-bit programs and supports full
virtual memory with paging to disk. 

Requirements:

A 80386-based IBM compatible PC or PS/2, approximately 4-5Mb of hard
drive space, and 512K RAM.  Available extended (or expanded under VCPI)
memory is strongly recommended.

Supported Wares:

* Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)
* Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
* SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768
* 80387
* XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies
* VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX
* DPMI programs, such as Windows 3.x, OS/2, and QDPMI

Unsupported:

* Multiprocessing (fork())

Many thanks to the sysops at Clarkson for providing a home to djgpp!

As a convenience to non-FTP users, djgpp is also stored on Clarkson's
archive server.  To access the archive server, do this:

   % mail archive-server@omnigate.clarkson.edu
   Subject: <none>
   help
   index msdos/djgpp
   ^D

NOTE: In accordance with FSF CopyLeft, you are not allowed to upload
this program to a distribution site unless you upload the source modules
with any binary module you upload.  Please read the file COPYING for
more details. 

NOTE: If your application links in object modules that were written by
FSF, your application counts as a "derived work" and must obey the
provisions of the FSF Copyrights.  See the file COPYING for details. 
All FSF source-based libraries are in the file libgpl.a.  The mere act
of compiling does not affect the copyright status of your program. 









INSTALLING:

To install, you must do the following:

* Create a "temp" directory, like c:\tmp.

* Create a directory to install in, like c:\djgpp.

* Un-zip the appropriate zipfiles in the install directory.
    C:\DJGPP> pkunzip -d -o djdev110.zip
    C:\DJGPP> pkunzip -d -o gas211bn.zip
    C:\DJGPP> pkunzip -d -o gcc241bn.zip
    C:\DJGPP> pkunzip -d -o bnu22bn.zip

* Add the following lines to C:\CONFIG.SYS file (or edit existing
  files= and shell= lines as appropriate).  The files= line prevents "too many
  open files" errors when compiling, and the shell= line prevents "Out of
  environment space" errors when setting lots of environment variables.

    files=15
    shell=c:\command.com c:\ /e:600 /p

The values 15 and 600 are close to minimal.  You may want to increase them
to provide a little more margin.


* Add the following lines to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    set COMPILER_PATH=c:/djgpp/bin
    set C_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/djgpp/include
    set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/djgpp/cplusinc;c:/djgpp/include
          ^^^ only needed if you are compiling c++ programs
    set OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/djgpp/include
          ^^^ only needed if you are compiling objective-C programs
    set OBJCPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/djgpp/include
          ^^^ only needed if you are compiling objective-C++ programs
    set LIBRARY_PATH=c:/djgpp/lib
    set TMPDIR=c:/tmp
             ^^^ this is where gcc's temp files go
    set GO32TMP=c:/tmp
                ^^^ this is where your paging file goes - if not set, the
                    variables TMP and TEMP are checked in that order
    set GO32=ansi driver c:/djgpp/drivers/SOMETHING.grd gw 1024 gh 768
                         ^^^ whatever driver works with your VGA (optional)
    set BISON_SIMPLE=c:/djgpp/lib/bison.simple
          ^^^ only needed if you use bison
    set BISON_HAIRY=c:/djgpp/lib/bison.hairy
          ^^^ only needed if you use bison
    set FLEX_SKELETON=c:/djgpp/lib/flex.skeleton
          ^^^ only needed if you use flex

  Remember that unless you manually type these at the command line,
  they won't take effect until you reboot.  Don't include the "ansi"
  keyword in the "go32" variable if you don't have an ANSI.SYS driver
  or equivalent.

* Add your binaries directory to your PATH in C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
    SET PATH= . . . ;C:\DJGPP\BIN

That's it! djgpp is now installed on your system.





The GO32 environment variable:


This variable controls the options available in go32 or debug32.  The
syntax of this variable is:

  SET GO32=[parm [value]] [parm [value]] . . .

Parameters:

  ansi           Use ANSI commands to control the color in debug32
  mono           Use the Monochrome monitor for debugging - useful when
                   debugging graphics applications
  1rm            Redirect stdout (file #1) to the monochrome monitor
  2rm            Redirect stderr (file #2) to the monochrome monitor
  1r2            Redirect stdout (file #1) to stderr (file #2)
  2r1            Redirect stderr (file #2) to stdout (file #1)

  glob           enable globbing (default)
  noglob         disable globbing

  emu [path]     Use the specified file as the 80387 emulator

  driver [path]  Use the specified file as the graphics driver
  gw [width]     Default graphics width
  gh [height]    Default graphics height
  tw [width]     Default text width
  th [height]    Default text height
  nc [colors]    Number of colors (for new-style drivers only - see cbgrx*.zip)


These parameters may occur in any order.

Note that "1rm" and "2rm" are done before "1r2" and "2r1", so "1rm 2r1" sends
stdout to the mono monitor and stderr to any redirection used.

Examples:

  C:\> set GO32=mono driver c:\djgpp\drivers\tseng4k.grd gw 1024 gh 768 tw 132 th 43 nc 256
  C:\> set GO32=ansi
  C:\> set GO32=driver c:\djgpp\drivers\tseng4k.grd ansi
  C:\> set GO32=mono 1rm 2rm










Deviations and Caveats:

GCC/G++ deviates from the U**x version in a number of ways, mostly to
accomodate deficiencies in the MS-DOS environment, and my own laziness.

* An 80387 is required to do floating point.  An emulator is provided.
  cc1 and cc1plus shouldn't use the 387 unless compiling floating point
  code.  The environment variable "387" can override the auto-detection
  routine:
    SET 387=YES   to force 387 handlers to be enabled
    SET 387=NO    to force 387 accesses to fault
    SET 387=QUERY to get a message showing the results of the auto-detection
  If no 80387 is present and the program attempts to use it, a message
  indicating where the instruction is will be displayed.  To use the
  387 emulator, add "emu c:\djgpp\emu387\emu387" to the GO32 environment
  variable.  Specifying use of the emulator overrides the "387"
  environment variable and autodetection code.

* The VDISK method of allocating extended memory is supported.  The
  INT 15h method is also.  When the extender runs out of conventional and
  extended memory, it uses a paging file named $(GO32TMP)/pgXXXXXX.386, where
  XXXX is an unspecified hex value.  This file is normally removed on exit.

* Up to 128 MB of physical memory and 128 MB of disk swap space are allowed.
  A 512K machine is sufficient, but very slow due to paging.

* The utilies support the MS-DOS standard response file method for giving
  more than 128 bytes of command line.  Example: "gcc -o foo @foo.lnk" where
  foo.lnk contains a list of .o files.  Wildcard expansion (globbing) is
  performed on the parameters, unless they are surrounded by single quotes.
  Double quotes can be used to prevent spaces from separating arguments.
  Also supported is the GNUish-DOS method of passing arguments in
  environment variables.

* Since MS-DOS does not distinguish case in file names, some .h files
  used for C++ have had underscores prepended to them to avoid conflict
  (ie: String.h conflicts with string.h, so it became _String.h).

* The extender can be added to any gcc-compiled program by copying go32.exe
  to be <program>.exe, where <program> is the 32-bit program.  For example,
  if "hello" is a gcc-compiled a.out file, and "hello.exe" is a copy of
  go32.exe, then when "hello.exe" runs, it loads the file called "hello"
  in the same directory, and executes it if present.  Otherwise,
  the first parameter is the executable (ie: go32 cc1plus foo.cc).

* The extender can be merged to create one .exe file that is the extender
  and the executable in one file, by using the stub.exe program:
      copy /b stub.exe+myprog myprog.exe
       -or-
      aout2exe myprog
  This will only work if go32.exe is in your search path, because stub.exe
  runs it.  Alternatively, you can prepend go32.exe itself to an a.out file
  to get a single executable (stub.exe is much smaller).  Note that if
  you re-compile go32 or stub, you must strip off the symbol table first. 
  Also note that aout2exe is designed to align the executable image for
  better performance, so aout2exe'd programs will run faster than those
  built with copy /b.

* The extender runs programs at logical address 0.  A copy of the first
  1 MB of physical memory (including the AT channel) is mapped to
  0xE0000000 in the program's address space.  The stack grows down from
  0x7FFFFFFC in the program's address space.  Data usually starts at
  0x00400000.  These numbers may be different under DPMI.

* The paging mechanism understands how SuperVGA's map their memory onto
  the AT bus and automatically swaps pages as the program tries to
  access them.  The program sees a linear range from 0xD0000000 to
  0xD0100000 that corresponds to each pixel in the 256-color modes
  of SuperVGAs.  To use this feature, you'll have to set the GO32
  environment variable like this:
    C>set go32=driver c:\djgpp\drivers\tseng4k.grd gw 640 gh 480 tw 132 th 43
  These parameter pairs can be omitted or rearranged as needed.  They are
  the "driver" name, default graphics width and height, and default
  text width and height. Libgr.a doesn't have to be recompiled, nor
  do graphics programs, when a different graphics mode is selected
  (the extender handles it).  It is strongly recommended that the program
  use the GR_default_graphics and GR_default_text modes to switch to
  graphics or text.  These modes use the parameters specified by the
  GO32 environment variable, allowing the user to select a favorite
  graphics and text mode.

* Symbols are stored in virtual memory, so you won't run out of symbol
  space until both extended memory and the disk are all used up.  For
  large programs, you might notice a slight delay while it looks up
  symbols.  Programs with a lot of lines in a given module may run out
  of memory as the line number table is built in real memory and transferred
  to virtual memory.

* Signals are not reported to the program.  However, interrupts do continue
  to get serviced while in protected mode (ie: keypress, timer, etc).
  CTRL-C will get you back to the debugger in debug32, and you can continue
  from where you stopped.  All signals (ie: exceptions) cause debugging
  traps in debug32, or general faults in go32.
