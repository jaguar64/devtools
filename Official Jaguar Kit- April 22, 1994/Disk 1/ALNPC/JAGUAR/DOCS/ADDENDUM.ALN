ADDENDUM for ALN (since version 1.11)

ALN now takes 68K BSD objects files (like those output by GCC).
(MADMAC needs -fb option in order to output BSD object files).
This allows input of symbols of any length.
It also outputs COFF encapsulated BSD programs (only in absolute).
This allows output of symbols of any length.
It understands DBX source-level informations optionally generated by MADMAC
(with the -g option) and GCC (with the -g option). THIS ONLY WORKS with BSD
OBJECTS! So you must use the -fb option with MADMAC.

Some switches have been added:
	-? Prints usage.
	-e Output COFF encapsulated BSD programs (only in absolute).
	-g Output source-level (if present in input object files).
	-ii Same as -i without truncating symbols to 8 characters.
	-r<size>: Section alignment size.
		-w: word (2 bytes)
		-l: long (4 bytes)
		-p: phrase (8 bytes, default alignment)
		-d: double phrase (16 bytes)
		-q: quad phrase (32 bytes)
