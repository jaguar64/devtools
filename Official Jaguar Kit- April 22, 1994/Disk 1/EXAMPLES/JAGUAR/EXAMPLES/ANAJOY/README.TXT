ANAJOY is a Jaguar program designed to test analog joysticks.  It prints a
bounding box on screen and then draws a sprite pointer on screen.  As you
move the analog joystick, the sprite moves around on screen.

There are several somewhat quick and dirty parts to this program, especially
the line-drawing stuff which could be done in a faster and yet more general
way using the blitter.

The numbers shown at the top left corner of the screen are the raw joystick
position values.  These are then scaled and offset slightly to position the
sprite onscreen. See the source code for details.
